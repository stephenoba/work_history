•	justify-self specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the row axis
•	align-items specifies how individual elements should spread across the column axis
•	align-content specifies how groups of elements should spread across the column axis
•	align-self specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the column axis
•	grid-auto-rows specifies the height of rows added implicitly to the grid
