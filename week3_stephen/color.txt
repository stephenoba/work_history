There are four ways to represent color in CSS:
•	Named colors — there are 147 named colors, which you can review here.

•	Hexadecimal or hex colors
o	Hexadecimal is a number system with has sixteen digits, 0 to 9 followed by "A" to "F".
o	Hex values always begin with # and specify values of red, blue and green using hexademical numbers such as #23F41A.

•	RGB
o	RGB colors use the rgb() syntax with one value for red, one value for blue and one value for green.
o	RGB values range from 0 to 255 and look like this: rgb(7, 210, 50).

•	HSL
o	HSL stands for hue (the color itself), saturation (the intensity of the color), and lightness (how light or dark a color is).
o	Hue ranges from 0 to 360 and saturation and lightness are both represented as percentages like this: hsl(200, 20%, 50%).

You can add opacity to color in RGB and HSL by adding a fourth value, a, which is represented as a percentage.
Great job! Feel empowered to add a bit of color to each of your projects!
