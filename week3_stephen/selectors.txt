In this lesson I learned how to select HTML elements with
CSS and apply styles to them.

1. CSS can change the look of HTML elements. In order to do
this, CSS must select HTML elements, then apply styles to
them.

2. CSS can select HTML elements by tag, class, or ID.

3. Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.

4. Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.

5. IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more
specific than tags. That means IDs will override any styles
from a class, and classes will override any styles from a
tag selector.

6. Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an
element. This raises the specificity, but can be necessary.

7. Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors
with a space.

8. The !important flag will override any style, however it
should almost never be used, as it is extremely difficult
to override.

9. Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles
by separating the selector names with commas.
