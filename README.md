# Work history
This repo will be used to keep a record of your work while at Enye

# Weekly Git Workflow
  * At the start of each weeks curriculum, you will create a folder within the work history repo and title it according to the following pattern:
  ```
    week{{week_number}}_{{your_first_name}}
  ```
    * Ex: If it was week 2, the folder title for me would be - week2_uche
  * For each professional section on codecademy we require that you:
    * Create a file or files under its corresponding week’s folder and name it according to this pattern:
    ```
    {{name_of_professional_section}}_{{name_of_file_in_professional_section}}
    ```
      * For example in week 2’s HTML Element and Structure module the professional project is called fashion blog
      ```
      fashion_blog_{{name_of_file_in_professional_Section}}
      ```
      * There is an index.html in this project
      ```
      fashion_blog_index.html
      ```
    * Create a file of a similar name inside of the `week{{week_number}}_{{your_first_name}}` folder that you created
    * Copy all the code from the codecademy file to your local file
  * Save and Push the changes to your forked repo
  * Keep in mind that we will be checking your work history repo weekly
