FUNCTIONS

Functions are written to perform a task.
Functions take data, perform a set of tasks on the data, and then return the result.
We can define parameters to be used when calling the function.
When calling a function, we can pass in arguments, which will set the function's parameters.
We can use return to return the result of a function which allows us to call functions anywhere, even inside other functions.
