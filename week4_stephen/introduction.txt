Introduction to JavaScript

Let's take one more glance at the concepts we just learned:

Four essential data types in JavaScript include strings, numbers, booleans, and null.
Data is printed, or logged, to the console with console.log().
Four built-in mathematical operators include +, -, *, and /.
JavaScript associates certain properties with different data types.
JavaScript has built-in methods for different data types.
Libraries are collections of methods that can be called without an instance.
You can write single-line comments with // and multi-line comments between /* and */.


Review Variables

Let's review what we learned:

Variables hold reusable data in a program.
JavaScript will throw an error if you try to reassign const variables.
You can reassign variables that you create with the let keyword.
Unset variables store the primitive data type undefined.
Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.
The + operator is used to interpolate (combine) multiple strings.
In JavaScript ES6, backticks (`) and ${} are used to interpolate values into a string.
