this are some of the html tags i learnt this week.

1.	Headings and sub-headings, <h1> to <h6>tags, are used
to enlarge text.

2.	<p>, <span> and <div> tags specify text or blocks.

3.	The <em> and <strong> tags are used to emphasize text.

4.	Line breaks are created with the <br> tag.

5.	Ordered lists (<ol>) are numbered and unordered lists
(<ul>) are bulleted.

6.	Images (<img>) and videos (<video>) can be added by
linking to an existing source.

7.	Anchor tags (<a>) are used to link to internal pages,
external pages or content on the same page.

8.	You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them
using <a> tags and addings ids to the elements you wish to
jump to.

9.	The nav element contains links to internal pages or
content.
