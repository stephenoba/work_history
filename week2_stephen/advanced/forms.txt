When creating an HTML form this are the basic tags and attributes.

1. <form> which defines the form

2. <input> which is the most important tag when creating forms and has
various forms like;
<input type="text">
<input type="password">
<input type="checkbox">
<input type="radio">
<input type="submit">

3. <textarea> which is basically for large multi-line text box.
The anticipated number of rows and columns can be defined with
the row and cols attribute.

The <select> tag works with the <option> tag to create drop down
select boxes

 The name attribute is to be added to all the tags in the forms
 in order for it not to be ignored when hooked up to a
 form-handling script.
